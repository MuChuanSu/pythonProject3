# pythonProject3
This is a simple Pong game made with python and turtle library.
Following a youtube tutorial by freecodecamp: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGf2GcyHPhc

The 2 player game is playable, but can be improved.
1. There is only one big .py file for the game, it is not a good practice, needs to be split into smaller classes
2. There is no end-game trigger yet, can be set later.
